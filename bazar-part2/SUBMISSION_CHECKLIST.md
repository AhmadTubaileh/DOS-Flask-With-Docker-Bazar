# Submission Checklist - Lab 2

Based on the assignment requirements, here's what you need to submit:

## ✅ 1. Source Code with Inline Comments/Documentation

### Required Files:

- [ ] All Dockerfiles (frontend, catalog, order)

**Check:**
- [ ] Code has inline comments explaining functionality
- [ ] Functions are documented
- [ ] Complex logic is explained
- [ ] Cache implementation is commented
- [ ] Replication logic is documented

---

## ✅ 2. Output Generated by Running Your Program

### Required Output Files:
- [ ] Screenshots/images showing program execution:
  - [ ] `docs/output/INFO.jpg` - Info endpoint working
  - [ ] `docs/output/search.jpg` - Search endpoint working
  - [ ] `docs/output/purchase.jpg` - Purchase endpoint working
  - [ ] `docs/output/CMD.jpg` - Command line output
- [ ] Text output files (optional but recommended):
  - [ ] Docker logs output
  - [ ] Test execution output

**Location:** All output files should be in `bazar-part2/docs/output/`

---

## ✅ 3. Design Document (2-3 pages)

### Required Sections:
- [ ] **Overall Program Design**
  - Architecture diagram (text or image)
  - Component descriptions
  - System flow
  
- [ ] **How It Works**
  - Request flow (client → frontend → servers)
  - Caching mechanism
  - Replication protocol
  - Load balancing algorithm
  - Cache invalidation process

- [ ] **Design Tradeoffs**
  - Why round-robin load balancing?
  - Why integrated cache vs separate cache server?
  - Why synchronous replication?
  - Performance vs consistency tradeoffs

- [ ] **Possible Improvements and Extensions**
  - LRU cache replacement policy
  - Cache size limits
  - Asynchronous replication
  - Least-loaded load balancing
  - Cache warming strategies

- [ ] **How to Run the Program**
  - Prerequisites (Docker Desktop)
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Docker commands
  - How to test endpoints
  - How to verify replication

**Location:** `bazar-part2/docs/BAZAR-report.pdf` (or create new document)

**Format:** PDF or Word document, 2-3 pages

---

## ✅ 4. Performance Results Documentation

### Required Content:
- [ ] **Performance Results Tables**
  - Comparison table (Part 1 vs Part 2)
  - Response times for each operation
  - Improvement percentages

- [ ] **Graphs/Charts**
  - Bar chart: Part 1 vs Part 2 response times
  - Line chart: Improvement percentages
  - (Optional) Cache hit/miss analysis

- [ ] **Brief Explanations**
  - Why Info Query shows minimal difference
  - Why Search Query shows improvement
  - Why Purchase is slower (replication overhead)
  - Cache consistency overhead analysis

**Location:** `bazar-part2/docs/performance_results.md` or include in main report

**Format:** Tables, graphs, and explanations
